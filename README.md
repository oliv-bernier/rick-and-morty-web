# rick-and-morty-web

Welcome to my Rick and Morty project.
I made this site to train on React and Redux.

By relying on a public API, I was able to make Ajax requests and manage some features such as a completely autonomous pagination component while taking care of the user interface.

The site is available here : https://ramw.surge.sh/

The Public API:

I hope you like this little site.
